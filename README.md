# YoGit!
This is a small Python script that opens a random URL of a public GitHub repository which has been recently created and updated. This will be done by accessing a list of the 100 most recent repositories using the GitHub API. One of these repository URLs will then be randomly chosen to be opened in your web browser.

# How to run YoGit!
Simply launch YoGit! by downloading the .py file and running it (command line: "python yogit.py"). A random repository page will be opened soon afterwards.

Have fun exploring GitHub and maybe finding a new inspiring repository.
